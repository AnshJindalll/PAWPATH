              Founded in 2025, PawPath was born from a simple belief: every dog deserves a loving home. We've built a
              comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between rescue dogs in need and families ready to provide them
              with the love and care they deserve.

                <p>
                  PawPath started when our founder, Sarah, visited a local animal shelter and was heartbroken by the
                  number of wonderful dogs waiting for homes. She realized that many potential adopters simply didn't
                  know these dogs existed, while shelters struggled to reach the right families.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What began as a simple website to showcase local shelter dogs has grown into a comprehensive platform
                  connecting rescue organizations across the country with loving families. We've streamlined the
                  adoption process, making it easier for both shelters and adopters to find their perfect match.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we're proud to work with over 150 pounds, shelters, and rescue organizations, helping thousands
                  of dogs find their forever homes. But our work is far from over â€“ every day, more dogs enter the
                  system, and we're committed to helping every single one find the love they deserve.
